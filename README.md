# formtek
A lightweight and secure contact form plugin for WordPress (currently WIP).

# goal

The purpose of this plugin is to integrate with "Captchatek" which is a secure and easy-to-use CAPTCHA system for your plugin. Formtek aims to integrate with this and leverage some of the functionality in "Captchatek".

# docker-compose.yaml

This file is used to deploy a fresh WordPress instance running on localhost. I use this for development and I simply added it to make life easy for redeployment.
